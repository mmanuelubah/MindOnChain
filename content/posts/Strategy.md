> [!info]+ **Important**
> 
> **MyEasyAgent** is more than a business; it is a mission-driven PropTech platform aimed at bridging the gap between the “average Nigerian” and their right to a home. In a market like Lagos, where personal networks (“Who you know”) often outweigh financial capability (“What you pay”), MyEasyAgent prioritizes **performance, trust, and transparency** over deep pockets. This blueprint defines the **What, Why, and How** of our journey, providing a clear roadmap for execution.

---

# **1. Executive Summary**

**MyEasyAgent** is a trust-centric PropTech ecosystem tailored specifically for the Nigerian real estate market. Unlike conventional listing sites that prioritize paid visibility, our platform leverages:

- **Performance-Based Ranking:** Agents are ranked by delivery, not by payment.
    
- **Usage-Based Monetization:** Users pay only when actively hunting for homes.
    

### **1.1 Problem Statement**

The Nigerian real estate market suffers from:

1. Fraudulent listings
    
2. Exploitative agency fees
    
3. Lack of verified property intelligence
    

### **1.2 Solution**

Our solution integrates:

- **Regulated Commitment Fees:** ₦2,500 per inspection to ensure accountability
    
- **Verified Property Intelligence:** Physical and digital audits of properties via HomeView
    

### **1.3 Mission**

To democratize access to affordable, verified housing in Nigeria through transparent, tech-enabled connections.

### **1.4 Vision**

To establish **MyEasyAgent** as the **primary trust infrastructure** in Nigerian real estate, eliminating fear of exploitation and ensuring safe transactions for all users.

---

# **2. Business Model & Strategy**

### **2.1 Revenue Model**

Our revenue framework is designed for **sustainability**, **alignment with user success**, and **scalability**.

#### **2.1.1 Unit Economics**

1. **HuntSmart Pass (Primary Revenue Driver)**
    
    - ₦15,000 usage-based pass
        
    - Includes 1 complimentary inspection
        
    - 4 additional prioritized inspection slots (subject to ₦2,500 commitment fee)
        
2. **Commitment Fees:** ₦2,500 per inspection
    
    - **Platform Share:** ₦500 (operational overhead, verification)
        
    - **Agent Share:** ₦2,000 (incentivizes attendance, covers transport)
        

#### **2.1.2 Commission Split (Performance Fees)**

1. **Direct Deals:** 50/50 split between agent and platform
    
2. **Sub-Direct Deals:** 50/25/25 split (Direct Agent / Sub-Direct Agent / Platform)
    

#### **2.1.3 Scalability Plan**

- Users only pay when actively hunting, avoiding subscription fatigue
    
- Platform can scale without forcing long-term subscriptions
    

---

### **2.2 Market Positioning**

**MyEasyAgent** is positioned as a **Trust Infrastructure & Matchmaker**, not just a listing site.

1. **Challenges with Traditional Sites**
    
    - Platforms like PropertyPro.ng and Nigeria Property Centre operate on “Pay-to-Play” subscriptions.
        
    - Leads are generated but results and safety are not guaranteed.
        
2. **Core Positioning Statement**
    
    > “For the average Nigerian and hustling Lagos family tired of ghost listings and exploitative agency fees, MyEasyAgent guarantees verified property access through a performance-based connector.”
    
3. **Solving Transaction Leakage**
    
    - Prevents offline deal skimming (“Sidelining”) using a **Digital Handshake (QR Check-in)**
        
    - Tracks deals from inspection to closing

> [!tip] **Tips for Competitive Advantage:**
> 
> - **Flood-Proof Filter:** Use flood-data tags to mitigate Lagos-specific flooding challenges.
>     
> - **Agent Identity Tier:** Differentiate **Verified Key-Holders** (Direct access) from **Property Scouts** (Semi-direct), enhancing transparency for clients.
>

# **4. Risk Assessment: The "Bad Sides"**

Even with safeguards, these risks exist:

1. **Agent Resistance:** 25–50% commission is significantly higher than 0% competitors charge
    
2. **Sidelining Vulnerability:** Agents may try to hide deals to retain full commission
    
3. **Scaling Bottlenecks:** Manual HomeView inspections are resource-intensive
    
4. **Market Speed vs. Process:** Lagos rental deals move fast; legal reviews may be perceived as delays
    
5. **Legal Limits:** Provisional Offer ≠ Tenancy Agreement; due diligence still required
    
6. **Upfront Fee Psychology:** Users expect free browsing, overcoming this is critical
    

---

# **5. Strategic Solutions & Success Probabilities**

### **5.1 Success Probability (Risk-Weighted)**

- **Financial Sustainability:** 70% (Revenue from HuntSmart Pass & Commitment Fees)
    
- **Trust & Adoption:** 55% (Overcoming psychological barriers)
    
- **Sidelining Prevention:** 40% (Requires strong digital “locks”)
    

### **5.2 Solution Set**

1. **Leakage Prevention:** Legal Review Lock warns clients that paying without verification voids platform protections
    
2. **Scaling via Graduated Trust:** HomeView Badge for team-verified properties; incentivized video walkthroughs for agent-verified listings
    
3. **Remote Handover Script:** Semi-Direct agents can avoid site travel while protecting commission splits
    
4. **Fast Market Fix:** Instant Digital Receipts sent to agents/clients immediately upon “I Want This House” click

# **6. HomeView Audit & Checklist**

> [!danger] **Do not launch without at least 20 HomeView-verified properties.** Launching an empty platform undermines HuntSmart Pass value.

- Security: fence height, gate integrity, general access
    

#### **B. Utilities & Services**

#### **C. Interior Audit**

Perfect. We can create a **Client Consent & Undertaking Form** that clearly outlines **all potential risks, limitations, and responsibilities** while making it explicit that the platform tries to safeguard them but cannot guarantee outcomes beyond its control. This will serve as both a **legal shield for MyEasyAgent** and a clear guide for clients to understand their obligations.

Here’s a detailed, professional, and **clickable-ready version**:

# **MyEasyAgent Client Consent & Undertaking Form**

This form ensures that every client understands the terms of engagement with **MyEasyAgent**, the limitations of the platform, and their responsibilities during property searches, inspections, and transactions.

By signing this form, I, the undersigned client, **acknowledge and agree** to the following:

---

## **1. Acknowledgment of Platform Role**

1. I understand that **MyEasyAgent acts as a facilitator and trust infrastructure**.
    
2. The platform **does not guarantee** that:
    
    - Agents will follow the **10% commission rule**.
        
    - All listed properties will be inspected by MyEasyAgent.
        
    - All agents are fully honest or infallible.
        
3. MyEasyAgent will **endeavor to inspect properties** or ensure agents do so, but inspections may not always occur.
    
4. The platform provides a **verified agent network**, but **verification is not an absolute guarantee of honesty or performance**.

## **2. Client Responsibilities**

1. Always carry and use your **Unique Booking ID** for every inspection.
    
2. Click **“Completed”** on the platform only after inspections are physically done. This serves as the **official handshake** between client, agent, and platform.

4. Regularly **check your email and platform dashboard** for notifications, including **smart match offers** and inspection updates.

- Payment errors, cancellations, or misunderstandings are limited to the platform’s terms of service.
    

**D. Legal Limitations**
