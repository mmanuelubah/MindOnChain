My screen was filled with other people&amp;rsquo;s highlights, and i felt behind.&lt;br&gt;
I was tired, anxious, and scrolling through a life that wasn&amp;rsquo;t mine.&lt;/p&gt;

I kept only what built me up.
The noise faded. My mind cleared.
I could breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often treat our lives and our businesses like our social feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We add and add. More features. More steps. More rules.
